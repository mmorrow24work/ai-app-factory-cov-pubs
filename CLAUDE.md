docs/journal.md                    Per-issue build metrics, appended by the workflow only — never edit by hand
.github/workflows/claude.yml       The Lane B driver
.github/scripts/journal-entry.sh   Metrics-append script the workflow calls
.env                               Local secrets — never commit, see .env.example

## Conventions

- **Never edit `docs/journal.md` by hand or from within a PR branch.** It's appended by `.github/workflows/claude.yml` *after* your PR merges, via `.github/scripts/journal-entry.sh`. Editing it in your branch means every open PR touches the same file and goes conflicting the moment any other PR merges.
- **If an issue asks you to create or edit an HTML page, link `theme.css`/`theme-toggle.js` into it rather than inventing your own theming or color scheme.** `<link rel="stylesheet" href="theme.css">` in `<head>`, then a plain blocking `<script src="theme-toggle.js"></script>` right after it (not `defer`, not `type="module"` — it needs to run before first paint to avoid a flash of the wrong theme). No HTML changes beyond those two tags are required — the toggle button is injected automatically if the page doesn't already have one. Project-specific CSS can still override `theme.css`'s custom properties (`--color-bg`, `--color-fg`, `--color-muted`, `--color-border`, `--color-accent`, `--font-sans`) or any of its rules; it's a starting point, not a constraint.
- Keep commit and PR scope to the files named in the issue or in the repo map above.
- (none yet — add project-specific conventions here as they come up)

## Definition of done

- The issue's acceptance criteria are met.
- Tests pass: `pytest`.
- Any shell script added is `bash -n`-clean and executable (`chmod +x`).
- Any JSON added is valid (`jq . <file>` succeeds).
- PR description explains what you implemented, what you verified, and anything you could not verify unattended.
